In November 2015 [we reported on over 2,000 malnutrition cases being reported in hospitals across England](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34777348), a rise on previous years.

The figures were revealed as Tameside Hospital became the first NHS hospital in the UK to set up a permanent food bank on site.

The data was obtained through Freedom of Information requests by Birmingham City University MA student **Eiryo Saeki**.
